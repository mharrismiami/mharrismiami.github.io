	    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">For my entire life I've considered myself a pretty creative person. At a young age I've always enjoyed art classes and the idea of created things. As the years passed and I grew older, I started to use photoshop editers and other softwares to make digital pieces, 3-d models and videos. Going into college, I didn't exactly know how I could use my creativity towards a job, so I went with what I thought was a safe option of supply chain. But, when I really took a look into the major I realized that I don't think it's for me. So thats why a have the interest in trying out Emerging Technology in Business and Design, since I believe it aligns more with me as a person.</p>

	    <p style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;">Emerging Technology in Business and Design, based on my overview is a major that I can explore my creative side while also staying within business. This very much entices me and draws me in. I do also like the idea of marketing on top of that. So, the combination between the two, to possibly presue a job creating ads or making computer grapic pieces for a company seems to be something that I'd really enjoy.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center; margin-left: 35%; margin-right: 35%;">This interesting piece was the result of a creative freedom project that was assigned in my ESP 103 class last semester. The assignment was to create a album cover for our FYIC group. It was voted the best cover by the class.</p>
